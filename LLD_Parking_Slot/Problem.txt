TS LLD Parking Slot:-

Description:-
Create a class Named Vehicle. This class will have 3 params:-

(i) VehicleType (A Union Type of "Car", "Bike", "Bus"),
(ii) RegistrationNumber (Number)
(iii) Color (String)

Create 3 classes which will inherit the Vehicle class.:- Car, Bike, Bus.

The above 3 classes will not have any extra property other than it's parents properties. But the VehicleType will have a fixed value.

The VehicleType of Bike class will be Bike
Make sure all 3 classes will take 2 params with the below mentioned order:-

(i) RegistrationNumber
(ii) Color

There will be Slot class which will have 2 properties:-

(i) type(A Union Type of "Car", "Bike", "Bus")
(ii) isBooked (boolean)

Slot will only take type as params. By default isBooked will be false.

Make another class ParkingSlot which will have 2 properties

(i) maxLimit (Number)
(ii) parkingSpots (Array of Slot)
ParkingSlot will take only maxLimit as parameter & parkingSpots will be initialized with an empty array

ParkingSlot will also have 3 methods:-

(i) addSlots
(ii) availableSlot
(iii) bookSlot
addSlots takes a Slot as parameter, pushes the slot to the parkingSpots array if the length of parkingSpots is lessThan maxLimit and returns the length of the parkingSpots.

availableSlot takes a VehicleType as parameter and returns the number of Slot of that type which has isBooked false.

For a example lets say currently there are 2 Car slot and 3 Bus slot and among the 3 Bus slots one of them has isBooked true.

In this case if the availableSlot method is called with Bus it will return 2.

bookSlot takes any of the 3 Classes which inherits Vehicle as parameter, checks the parkingSpots array and tries to find a slot with same type passed as params.

If it is able to find out then makes the isBooked true for that Slot and returns true.

If its not able to find any such slot it returns false
